# MobEntityPathVisualizer [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/G2G33U110)
A visualizer tool to see the paths mobs want to take.

# Use:
This mod is intended for figuring out where mobs want to walk/move to.  It does this by querying the Living Entities PathNavigator and rendering the current path using a stream of particles: Red for the end point, Green for points in between, and White for direction between points.  Do note that this mod uses vanilla particles, so resource packs that change said particles will change the look of the path.

To see the path, craft the Path Scanner tool and hold it in your main-hand or off-hand.

# TODO
